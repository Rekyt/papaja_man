# Published manuscripts

If you have published a paper that was written with `papaja`, you can add the reference to the [public Zotero group](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2202906/papaja) yourself or send it to me.

```{r echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
papaja_readme <- readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crsh/papaja/devel/README.md")

reference_start <- which(grepl("Papers written with papaja", papaja_readme))
reference_end <- which(grepl("Other related R packages", papaja_readme))

papaja_readme <- gsub("###", "##", papaja_readme)

writeLines(paste(papaja_readme[(reference_start+1):(reference_end-1)], collapse = "\n"), "published_papers.Rmd")
```

```{r child = "published_papers.Rmd"}
```

```{r include = FALSE}
file.remove("published_papers.Rmd")
```
