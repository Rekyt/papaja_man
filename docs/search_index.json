This can be a nuisance if the bibliographic information is not maintained meticulously. Entries such as author = {John Doe} and author = {J. Doe} are taken to be different authors and will be disambiguated (i.e. “John Doe (1986)” and “J. Doe (1986)”). Disabling author name disambiguation is possible (although it is somewhat beyond the scope of papaja). The definition of the citation style used in papaja is given in a citation style language file (CSL, see [Additional-rendering-options]). We have created a variant of the widely available APA CSL file without author name disambiguation. To use this variant insert the following into YAML front matter: csl: https://tinyurl.com/apa6-no-disambiguation Alternatively, you can download the file and use the location on your hard drive instead of the above URL. Note that using this style can create the false impression that two works are authored by the same author when really they were not. For example, author = {John Doe} and author = {Jane Doe} will be displayed as “Doe (1986a)” and “Doe (1986b)”. If you prefer \\(\\LaTeX\\) to generate the bibliographic information, we recommend the following approach to disable author name disambiguation: lang : &quot;en-EN&quot; # Optional, added for clarity biblio-style : &quot;apa&quot; biblatexoptions : &quot;uniquename=false&quot; header-includes: - \\DeclareLanguageMapping{english}{english-apa} output: papaja::apa6_pdf: citation_package: biblatex Specifying lang is optional in this case, because en-EN is the default. pandoc converts en-EN to english and inserts it into the document preamble. Hence, english needs to be mapped to english-apa. Similarly, if you want, say, British english you would have to adapt the above as follows: lang : &quot;en-GB&quot; # Required header-includes: - \\DeclareLanguageMapping{british}{british-apa} A general drawback to this approach is that biblatex does not operate on any text in the YAML front matter. This can be a problem when, for example, the abstract contains citations. This problem can be addressed with the text references feature in bookdown. Replace the text of the abstract in the YAML front matter by abstract: (ref:abstract) (ref:abstract) is a placeholder for text that you can now define in the body of the R Markdown document (e.g., right after the YAML front matter): (ref:abstract) This is the abstract [@doe1986]. This text will now be processed and citations will be generated as expected. 5.5 Reproducible software environment sessionInfo() packrat checkpoint liftr &amp; docker 5.6 RStudio Document outline 5.7 Splitting an R Markdown document Some authors may prefer to split long manuscripts into multiple component files for better clarity. There are two basic strategies to split R Markdown documents that can be combined or used in isolation: sourcing R scripts and splitting the R Markdown document. If the R Markdown document contains a lot of code, it may be helpful to disincorporate parts of the code, such as reading, merging, restructuring, and relabeling data files. The R scripts can then be executed at the respective section of the document using source(). Some authors may prefer to split long manuscripts into a master or parent document and multiple children. The master document, for example, consists of the YAML front matter and includes the children, which are themselves R Markdown documents without a YAML front matter. To include a child document, insert an empty chunk and provide the path to the R Markdown document in the chunk option child. ```{r child = &quot;introduction.Rmd&quot;} ``` ```{r child = &quot;methods.Rmd&quot;} ``` ```{r child = &quot;results.Rmd&quot;} ``` ```{r child = &quot;discussion.Rmd&quot;} ``` 5.8 Workflow Don’t edit raw data Don’t set a working directory Generate graphics from R code Don’t edit word documents Relative paths 5.9 Adjusting line spacing According to the APA guidelines, “Tables may be submitted either single- or double-spaced.” (p. 141; American Psychological Association, 2010). Adjusting the line spacing of table contents is currently not supported in papaja. However, as usual it is possible to adjust the spacing in PDF documents by including additional \\(\\LaTeX\\) code. If you use apa_able(), including the following in the YAML front matter will result in single-spaced tables with double-spaced caption and table note: header-includes: - \\usepackage{setspace} - \\AtBeginEnvironment{tabular}{\\singlespacing} - \\AtBeginEnvironment{lltable}{\\singlespacing} - \\AtBeginEnvironment{tablenotes}{\\doublespacing} - \\captionsetup[table]{font={stretch=1.5}} - \\captionsetup[figure]{font={stretch=1.5}} Similarly, the line spacing of figure captions can be adjusted as follows: header-includes: - \\usepackage{setspace} - \\AtBeginEnvironment{tabular}{\\doublespacing} - \\AtBeginEnvironment{lltable}{\\doublespacing} - \\AtBeginEnvironment{tablenotes}{\\doublespacing} - \\captionsetup[table]{font={stretch=1.5}} - \\captionsetup[figure]{font={stretch=1}} 5.10 Troubleshooting 5.10.1 R References "]
