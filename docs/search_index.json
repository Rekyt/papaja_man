It is currently in the process of being written; I’m publishing new sections of the book as I’m writing them. If you have suggestions for improvements or additional topics you would like to see covered, please let me know by opening an issue on GitHub or creating a pull request. papaja has not yet been submitted to CRAN because it is under active development. Currently, there are still a couple of loose ends we would like to tie up before we release the package to a larger audience. If you would like to contribute to speed up the process, have a look at the chapters Limitations and Future directions. If you are interested in reproducible research with R more generally, I recommend the books by Xie (2015) and Gandrud (2013). Furthermore, Stodden, Leisch, &amp; Peng (2014) give an overview of tools, practices, and platforms to implement reproducible research. This manual is fully reproducible and was written in R (Version 3.4.3; R Core Team, 2016) and the R-packages afex (Version 0.18.0; Singmann, Bolker, Westfall, &amp; Aust, 2016), bindrcpp (Version 0.2; Müller, 2017), car (Version 2.1.6; Fox &amp; Weisberg, 2011), citr (Version 0.2.0.9055; Aust, 2016), DiagrammeR (Version 0.9.2; Sveidqvist et al., 2016), dplyr (Version 0.7.4; Wickham &amp; Francois, 2016), ez (Version 4.4.0; Lawrence, 2016), knitr (Version 1.19; Xie, 2015), lme4 (Version 1.1.14; Bates, Mächler, Bolker, &amp; Walker, 2015), lsmeans (Version 2.27.61; Lenth, 2016), papaja (Version 0.1.0.9655; Aust &amp; Barth, 2016), rmarkdown (Version 1.8; Allaire et al., 2017), shiny (Version 1.0.5; Chang, Cheng, Allaire, Xie, &amp; McPherson, 2016), and wordcountaddin (Version 0.2.0; Marwick, n.d.). ## Session info ------------------------------------------------------------- ## setting value ## version R version 3.4.3 (2017-11-30) ## system x86_64, linux-gnu ## ui X11 ## language en_US: ## collate en_US.UTF-8 ## tz Europe/Berlin ## date 2018-01-31 ## Packages ----------------------------------------------------------------- ## package * version date source ## assertthat 0.2.0 2017-04-11 CRAN (R 3.4.2) ## backports 1.1.1 2017-09-25 CRAN (R 3.4.2) ## base * 3.4.3 2017-12-01 local ## bindr 0.1 2016-11-13 CRAN (R 3.4.2) ## bindrcpp 0.2 2017-06-17 CRAN (R 3.4.2) ## bookdown 0.6 2018-01-25 cran (@0.6) ## brew 1.0-6 2011-04-13 CRAN (R 3.4.2) ## car * 2.1-6 2017-11-19 cran (@2.1-6) ## colorspace 1.3-2 2016-12-14 CRAN (R 3.4.2) ## compiler 3.4.3 2017-12-01 local ## datasets * 3.4.3 2017-12-01 local ## devtools 1.13.4 2017-11-09 CRAN (R 3.4.3) ## DiagrammeR * 0.9.2 2017-09-06 CRAN (R 3.4.2) ## digest 0.6.12 2017-01-27 CRAN (R 3.4.2) ## downloader 0.4 2015-07-09 CRAN (R 3.4.2) ## dplyr 0.7.4 2017-09-28 CRAN (R 3.4.2) ## evaluate 0.10.1 2017-06-24 CRAN (R 3.4.2) ## ez * 4.4-0 2016-11-02 CRAN (R 3.4.3) ## ggplot2 2.2.1 2016-12-30 CRAN (R 3.4.2) ## glue 1.1.1 2017-06-21 CRAN (R 3.4.2) ## graphics * 3.4.3 2017-12-01 local ## grDevices * 3.4.3 2017-12-01 local ## grid 3.4.3 2017-12-01 local ## gridExtra 2.3 2017-09-09 CRAN (R 3.4.2) ## gtable 0.2.0 2016-02-26 CRAN (R 3.4.2) ## hms 0.3 2016-11-22 CRAN (R 3.4.2) ## htmltools 0.3.6 2017-04-28 CRAN (R 3.4.2) ## htmlwidgets 0.9 2017-07-10 CRAN (R 3.4.2) ## igraph 1.1.2 2017-07-21 CRAN (R 3.4.2) ## influenceR 0.1.0 2015-09-03 CRAN (R 3.4.2) ## jsonlite 1.5 2017-06-01 CRAN (R 3.4.2) ## knitr 1.19 2018-01-29 cran (@1.19) ## lattice 0.20-35 2017-03-25 CRAN (R 3.3.3) ## lazyeval 0.2.0 2016-06-12 CRAN (R 3.4.2) ## lme4 1.1-14 2017-09-27 CRAN (R 3.4.2) ## magrittr 1.5 2014-11-22 CRAN (R 3.4.2) ## MASS 7.3-48 2017-12-24 CRAN (R 3.4.3) ## Matrix 1.2-11 2017-08-16 CRAN (R 3.4.1) ## MatrixModels 0.4-1 2015-08-22 CRAN (R 3.4.2) ## memoise 1.1.0 2017-04-21 CRAN (R 3.4.2) ## methods * 3.4.3 2017-12-01 local ## mgcv 1.8-22 2017-09-19 CRAN (R 3.4.1) ## minqa 1.2.4 2014-10-09 CRAN (R 3.4.2) ## munsell 0.4.3 2016-02-13 CRAN (R 3.4.2) ## nlme 3.1-131 2017-02-06 CRAN (R 3.4.0) ## nloptr 1.0.4 2017-08-22 CRAN (R 3.4.2) ## nnet 7.3-12 2016-02-02 CRAN (R 3.4.0) ## papaja * 0.1.0.9655 2018-01-29 local (crsh/papaja@NA) ## parallel 3.4.3 2017-12-01 local ## pbkrtest 0.4-7 2017-03-15 CRAN (R 3.4.2) ## pkgconfig 2.0.1 2017-03-21 CRAN (R 3.4.2) ## plyr 1.8.4 2016-06-08 CRAN (R 3.4.2) ## purrr 0.2.4 2017-10-18 CRAN (R 3.4.2) ## quantreg 5.34 2017-10-25 cran (@5.34) ## R6 2.2.2 2017-06-17 CRAN (R 3.4.2) ## RColorBrewer 1.1-2 2014-12-07 CRAN (R 3.4.2) ## Rcpp 0.12.14 2017-11-23 cran (@0.12.14) ## readr 1.1.1 2017-05-16 CRAN (R 3.4.2) ## reshape2 1.4.2 2016-10-22 CRAN (R 3.4.2) ## rgexf 0.15.3 2015-03-24 CRAN (R 3.4.2) ## rlang 0.1.4.9000 2017-11-27 Github (tidyverse/rlang@bd83400) ## rmarkdown * 1.8 2017-11-17 cran (@1.8) ## Rook 1.1-1 2014-10-20 CRAN (R 3.4.2) ## rprojroot 1.2 2017-01-16 CRAN (R 3.4.2) ## rstudioapi 0.7 2017-09-07 CRAN (R 3.4.2) ## scales 0.5.0 2017-08-24 CRAN (R 3.4.2) ## SparseM 1.77 2017-04-23 CRAN (R 3.4.2) ## splines 3.4.3 2017-12-01 local ## stats * 3.4.3 2017-12-01 local ## stringi 1.1.6 2017-11-17 cran (@1.1.6) ## stringr 1.2.0 2017-02-18 CRAN (R 3.4.2) ## tibble 1.3.4 2017-08-22 CRAN (R 3.4.2) ## tidyr 0.7.2 2017-10-16 CRAN (R 3.4.2) ## tools 3.4.3 2017-12-01 local ## utils * 3.4.3 2017-12-01 local ## viridis 0.4.0 2017-03-27 CRAN (R 3.4.2) ## viridisLite 0.2.0 2017-03-24 CRAN (R 3.4.2) ## visNetwork 2.0.1 2017-07-30 CRAN (R 3.4.2) ## withr 2.1.0 2017-11-01 cran (@2.1.0) ## xfun 0.1 2018-01-22 cran (@0.1) ## XML 3.98-1.9 2017-06-19 CRAN (R 3.4.2) ## yaml 2.1.16 2017-12-12 cran (@2.1.16) References "],
["introduction.html", "1 Introduction 1.1 Motivation 1.2 Implementation 1.3 Alternatives 1.4 Getting started", " 1 Introduction papaja is short for ‘preparing APA journal articles’ and is the name of this R package designed to create fully reproducible journal articles that seamlessly fuse statistical analyses, simulations, and prose. A manuscript written with papaja can be thought of as an extensively commented analysis script ready for publication in a scientific journal. 1.1 Motivation APA style is one of the major style regimes in academia concerned with written scientific communication and is defined in the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (APA; American Psychological Association, 2010). Research in psychology and many fields other, including other social sciences, medicine, and public health is reported in APA style. If you want to publish psychological research, you will have to produce properly formatted APA style manuscripts. While the merits of standardizing scientific reporting are undisputed, mastering the currently 272 pages of Publication Manual’s style definitions puts an undeniable burden on authors. To simplify the writing process researchers have developed strategies to automate the implementation of APA style. The dominant approach to writing scientific reports in psychology is the use of common word processors such as Microsoft Word or Libre Office. Available APA style document templates set up page margins, line spacing, fonts, and related aspects of the manuscript. The format of citations and references can be automated by using references managers that integrate with the word processor, such as Zotero. Far less common in psychology, is the use of markup systems, such as LaTeX or Markdown. A key concept of markup systems is to separate style from content by means of document annotations. These annotations declare portions of text for example as title, section headings, or list items but, crucially, they are agnostic to what this means visually (e.g., &lt;emphasize&gt;text&lt;/emphasize&gt; instead of text). There are several advantages to this approach but, crucially for the present purpose, markup systems compile plain text files to produce the final document. Critically, the compilation process is required for fully reproducible scientific reports. 1.1.1 Reproducible scientific reports Dynamic scientific reports fuse prose and simulation or analysis scripts (Gandrud, 2013; Xie, 2015). Each time a dynamic document is compiled, the scripts are executed anew and the results—statistics, tables, and figures—are recreated and inserted into the document. Thereby dynamic documents allow automated reporting of results, which is currently not possible with the prevalent use of Microsoft Word or Libre Office. Importantly, dynamic documents ensure that the results reported in the manuscript are free of rounding or transcription errors and correspond to the performed analyses. This is the reason why dynamic scientific reports are commonly referred to as reproducible scientific reports or reproducible reports. Thus, the term reproducibility here means that given a dataset and analysis script any analyst obtains the same statistical results (Asendorpf et al., 2013; Cacioppo, Kaplan, Krosnick, Olds, &amp; Dean, 2015). The importance of reproducibility was pinpointed by the U.S. National Science Foundation subcommittee on replicability in science: Reproducibility is a minimum necessary condition for a finding to be believable and informative. (p. 4, Cacioppo et al., 2015) Good statistical practice is fundamentally based on transparent assumptions, repro-ducible results, and valid interpretations. The ethical statistician […] strives to promote transparency in design, execution, and reporting or presenting of all analyses Makes documentation suitable for replicate analyses, metadata studies, and other research by qualified investigators. http://www.amstat.org/asa/files/pdfs/EthicalGuidelines.pdf “an article about a computational result is advertising, not scholarship. The actual scholarship is the full software environment, code and data, that produced the result.” - Buckheit &amp; Donoho, 1995 (Elsevier executable paper challenge: 10.1016/j.procs.2011.04.064) Donoho, D. L., Maleki, A., Rahman, I. U., Shahram, M. &amp; Stodden, V. Reproducible research in computational harmonic analysis. Comput. Sci. Eng. 11, 8–18 (2009). Donoho and fellow researchers have been at the forefront of reproducibility for many years; this a org-mode: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0928425711000374?via%3Dihub http://yuyang0.github.io/static/doc/babel.pdf Proprietary software also exists like Inference for R29 – for using R with Microsoft Office – but we do not have any experience with them. Open-source tools like Dexy30 and Sumatra31 are clearly very promising and have capabilities similar to Sweave and org-mode. R Markdown has been suggested as one possible framework for reproducible analyses (Allaire et al., 2017). papaja is a R-package in the making including a R Markdown template that can be used with (or without) RStudio to produce documents, which conform to the American Psychological Association (APA) manuscript guidelines (6th Edition). The package uses the document class apa6 and a .docx-reference file, so you can create PDF documents, or Word documents if you have to. Moreover, papaja supplies R-functions that facilitate reporting results of your analyses in accordance with APA guidelines. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax that can be used to author HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents (among others). In the following I will assume you have hopped onto the band wagon and know how to use R Markdown to conduct and comment your analyses. If this is not the case, I recommend you get to grips with R Markdown first. I use RStudio (which makes use of pandoc) to create my documents, but the general process works using any other text editor. Although LaTeX is widely used to write entire manuscripts (not just equations), it is not commonly used in the field of psychology. We suspect that the neglect is largely due to its complexity and shallow learning curve. Both appear to outweigh the advantages of the system when it comes to handling citations and cross-references or typesetting large documents, complex tables, and equations. Markdown paired with pandoc provides a simple interface to harness the power of LaTeX without requiring in-depth knowledge about LaTeX (see Document compilation). 1.2 Implementation In this section we provide a quick overview of the software and the underlying design principles. Unless you are interested in these details it’s safe to skip this section. 1.2.1 Guiding principles In our development of this package our design decisions are based on two guiding principles: papaja documents are convertible. A central motivation for the development of the package was the experience that many (if not most) scientific journals in psychology require that the final version of a submitted manuscript be provided as a Microsoft Word or RTF document. We, thus, strive to employ solutions that work for both LaTeX and Word output formats even if it means that some of the functions are less versatile than they could be. papaja does not compute. The package is meant to facilitate writing reports and manuscripts in APA style; it is not meant to analyse data. Functions provided in this package do as little computing as possible to grant authors maximal analytic flexibility. Moreover, limiting the amount of computing done by the package facilitates package maintenance. While we are guided by these principles, they are guidelines rather than commandments and we deviate from them if necessary. For example, papaja functions do compute statistics that should be routinely reported according to APA guidelines, such as confidence intervals, if they are not provided in the analysis output objects. We, however, try to enable customization and replacement of these defaults whenever we can. 1.2.2 Document compilation It is important to note that papaja builds on several existing R packages, which in turn build on other software, to compile the final document. This layered software design grants the package its capabilities but it comes at a cost: When compilation of a papaja-document throws an error it may not be immediately obvious to an inexperienced user, which part of the process failed. We, thus, provide an overview of the compilation process and the software involved. The compilation process is outlined in Figure 1.1. As detailed in the R Markdown components section, an R Markdown document consists of three components: A YAML front matter that contains document meta data, prose written in markdown (and optionally LaTeX) syntax, and R code in so-called code chunks. Additionally, the R code contained in an R Markdown document usually accesses data that are either stored in a file on the computers hard drive or a database on the local network or internet. When the document is compiled either by calling rmarkdown::render() or by clicking the Knit-button in RStudio, the YAML front matter is parsed. Errors during this processing step are usually due to erroneous YAML syntax and start with Error in yaml::yaml.load(enc2utf8(string), ...) :. Next, the R code inside the R Markdown document is executed sequentially from top to bottom of the document and the resulting output is inserted into the document in markdown syntax. Any figures that are generated during the execution of the R code are stored to the hard drive and embedded into the markdown document. The R code is executed in a new R session with an empty workspace, no attached packages, and with the working directory set to the path of the R Markdown file. If any portion of the R code throws an error the compilation is aborted. In RStudio the debugger will point to the first line of the R code chunk that threw the error—not the exact line responsible for the error—and report the error message. R error messages usually start with Error:, for example, Error: Object 'experiment_data' not found. Figure 1.1: Process diagram illustrating the compilation of reproducible reports written with papaja. Boxes represent input files, diamonds represent compiling software, and ovals represent output files. Dashed components are either implicit (components of R Markdown files) or by default deleted after the compilation and, thus, invisible to the user. After the R code has been executed the bookdown document format pdf_document2() or word_document2(), respectively, provides functions that enable the cross-referencing syntax \\@ref() described in the Cross-referencing section. Incorrect use of the cross-referencing syntax typically does not interfere with the document compilation but is apparent from missing or incorrect cross-references in the compiled document, e.g. instead of a figure number the document may contain the figure handle such as . The result of this processing step is a pure markdown document containing only a YAML header, prose in markdown (and optionally LaTeX) syntax and rendered images in PDF, EPS, PNG, and TIFF formats at 300 dpi as set by apa6_pdf() or apa6_word(), respectively. The markdown document, images and an optional BiB(La)TeX file that contains bibliographic information are the input to the next processing step. rmarkdown::render() assembles a system call to pandoc that is supplemented by papaja to include a call to an additional filter and can be further customized by the user. pandoc parses the contents of the markdown file and translates it into an abstract syntax tree (AST). The pandoc-citeproc filter is than applied to the AST to replace the citation markup by the citation text and insert a reference section. As detailed in the Citations section, pandoc-citeproc relies on the citation styles language (CSL), an XML-based specification of citation and bibliography formatting rules. Unfortunately, CSL does not support in-text citations. To overcome this limitation, pandoc-citeproc provides a separate syntax for in-text citations, which is based on the same CSL style. As a result the CSL APA6 style uses ampersands for all citations, including in-text citations, defying the APA citation style. That is why papaja provides an additional R-based filter that is applied to the AST to replace ampersands in in-text citations with the word and. After all filters have been applied to the AST pandoc converts the document into the target output format, that is, PDF or DOCX. To create DOCX-documents papaja provides a reference DOCX-file containing page setup and style definitions that pandoc uses to create the manuscript file. That is, pandoc translates the AST directly to the office open XML format. To create PDF-documents pandoc in turn relies on LaTeX, that is, pandoc translates the AST to a TeX-file based on a template provided by papaja. This template invokes the apa6 LaTeX document class [@???] and loads several additional LaTeX packages. pandoc then generates a system call to LaTeX to render the PDF document. During this processing step, that is, following the pandoc system calls, errors are due to failures of LaTeX to compile the TeX-file and usually start with !, for example, ! Undefined control sequence. or ! Missing $ inserted. 1.3 Alternatives Needless to say, not all journals require manuscripts to be prepared according to APA guidelines. Other journal templates for the rmarkdown package are available in the rticles package. It includes a set of templates for authoring of R related journal and conference submissions. papeR reportR &amp; apaStyle Sweave schoRsch (Pfister &amp; Janczyk, 2016) sigr 1.4 Getting started 1.4.1 Software requirements To use papaja you need to make sure the following software is installed on your computer: R 2.11.1 or later. pandoc 1.16 or later. If you work with RStudio (0.98.932 or later) pandoc should already be installed, otherwise install pandoc using the instructions for your operating system If you want to create PDF- in addition to DOCX-files you need TeX 2013 or later. Try MikTeX for Windows, MacTeX for Mac, or TeX Live for Linux. Some Linux users may need a few additional TeX packages for the LaTeX document class apa6 to work: sudo apt-get install texlive texlive-publishers texlive-fonts-extra texlive-latex-extra texlive-humanities lmodern Although not necessary for the use of papaja, I recommend that you use a references manager, such as Zotero, to facilitate reference management and citations. 1.4.2 Installing papaja Once all that is taken care of, install papaja from GitHub. # Install devtools package if necessary if(!&quot;devtools&quot; %in% rownames(installed.packages())) install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;) # Install papaja devtools::install_github(&quot;crsh/papaja&quot;) papaja has not yet been submitted to CRAN because it is under active development. Currently, there are still a couple of loose ends we would like to tie up before we release the package to a larger audience. If you would like to contribute to speed up the process, have a look at the chapters Limitations and Future directions. 1.4.3 Creating a document Once you have installed papaja and all other required software, the APA manuscript template is available through the RStudio menus when creating a new R Markdown file, Figure 1.3. Figure 1.3: papaja’s APA6 template is available through the RStudio menues. When you click RStudio’s Knit button (Figure 1.4) papaja, rmarkdown, and knitr work together to create an APA conform manuscript that includes both your manuscript text and the results of any embedded R code. Figure 1.4: The Knit button in the RStudio. If you don’t use RStudio, you can achieve the same result via the R command line. Use rmarkdown::draft() to create a new R Markdown file and rmarkdown::render() to render the document. # Create new R Markdown file rmarkdown::draft( &quot;mymanuscript.Rmd&quot; , &quot;apa6&quot; , package = &quot;papaja&quot; , create_dir = FALSE , edit = FALSE ) # Render manuscript rmarkdown::render(&quot;mymanuscript.Rmd&quot;) papaja is a R-package in the making including a R Markdown template that can be used with (or without) RStudio to produce documents, which conform to the American Psychological Association (APA) manuscript guidelines (6th Edition). The package uses the LaTeX document class apa6 and a .docx-reference file, so you can create PDF documents, or Word documents if you have to. Moreover, papaja supplies R-functions that facilitate reporting results of your analyses in accordance with APA guidelines. Because knitr does not allow duplicate chunk labels in a source document, you need to make sure there are no duplicate labels in your book chapters, otherwise knitr will signal an error when knitting the merged Rmd file.

["r-markdown-components.html", "2 R Markdown components 2.1 YAML front matter 2.2 Body", " 2 R Markdown components Generally, R Markdown files consist of two parts. The first is the YAML front matter that contains the documents meta information and rendering options. It is located at the top of the R Markdown document. The second part is the main body that contains R code chunks and prose in Markdown format. 2.1 YAML front matter YAML is a human-readable and easy to write language to define data structures. You don’t need to familiarize yourself intimately with YAML to use R Markdown or papaja and I suggest you try to just use it. The following is the default YAML front matter; it starts and ends with ---: --- title : &quot;The title&quot; shorttitle : &quot;Title&quot; author: - name : &quot;First Author&quot; affiliation : &quot;1&quot; corresponding : yes # Define only one corresponding author address : &quot;Postal address&quot; email : &quot;my@email.com&quot; - name : &quot;Ernst-August Doelle&quot; affiliation : &quot;1,2&quot; affiliation: - id : &quot;1&quot; institution : &quot;Wilhelm-Wundt-University&quot; - id : &quot;2&quot; institution : &quot;Konstanz Business School&quot; author_note: | Add complete departmental affiliations for each author here. Each new line herein must be indented, like this line. Enter author note here. abstract: | Enter abstract here. Each new line herein must be indented, like this line. keywords : &quot;keywords&quot; wordcount : &quot;X&quot; bibliography : [&quot;r-references.bib&quot;] figsintext : no figurelist : no tablelist : no footnotelist : no lineno : yes mask : no class : &quot;man&quot; output : papaja::apa6_pdf --- 2.1.1 Manuscript metadata Most of the information contained in the YAML front matter is information about the document. title is the full name of the manuscript that is printed on the title page and at the beginning of the introduction. shorttitle is a short variant of the title and is printed in the running head on every page. author is a structured list. Each author’s information is given in a separate element that is indented and starts with -. A full name and an affiliation symbol need to be provided for every author. The symbol is printed as superscript following the author’s name on the manuscripts title page and can be a combination of multiple symbols if the author has multiple affiliations (e.g., 1,2 yields Ernst-August Doelle1,2). Exactly one author has to be declared as corresponding author by adding corresponding: yes and the fields address and email to the author’s information. The latter two fields are used to automatically generate the last sentence of the author note that—as required by the APA guidelines—provides the corresponding author’s contact information. affiliation is another structured list that contains the institutions’ information; again each new element is indented and starts with -. id is printed as superscript in front of the institution name below the author names on the title page (e.g., 2 yields 2 Konstanz Business School). author_note and abstract contain the text for the corresponding sections of the manuscript. The | indicate that all following indented lines, including line breaks and new paragraphs, belong to this field. Thus, abstract and author_note can be structured into multiple paragraphs as shown above. keywords and wordcount1 are self-explanatory and the corresponding information is printed below the abstract on the second page of the manuscript. bibliography contains a list of one or more Bib(La)TeX files that contain the references cited in the manuscript. Additional files can be added by appending them to the list separated by commata, e.g. bibliography: [&quot;my_bib1.bib&quot;, &quot;my_bib2.bib&quot;]. By default, papaja assumes that you will cite R and all R packages used for the analysis and that the corresponding bibliographic information is contained in r-references.bib. See Citations for instructions on how to automate the citation of R packages. note is an add additional metadata field that are not part of the default YAML front matter. It’s contents is printed on title page in between author information and the author note; it can be used to add remarks, such as “Preprint submitted to peer-review on June, 29th, 2016”. 2.1.2 Rendering options The first set of rendering options breaks with the guiding principal that papaja is convertible because they have no effect on Microsoft Word documents. We decided to implement these options nonetheless because they are required by some journals and can be used for submissions where (initially) PDF/LaTeX documents are accepted. figsintext indicates whether figures and tables are to be positioned at the end of the document—as required by APA guidelines—or included in the body of the document. If figurelist, tablelist, or footnotelist are set to yes lists of figure captions, table captions, or footnotes are created and placed after the reference section. lineno indicates whether lines should be continuously numbered throughout the manuscript. The remaining rendering options affect both PDF and Microsoft Word documents. mask can be set to yes to prepare the manuscript for double-blind peer review by removing author names, affiliations, and author note from the title page. class defines the layout style of the manuscript. Setting class to man produces the default APA manuscript style, doc produces a more typical document (single-spaced, single-column). The latter option is, however, currently not available for Microsoft Word documents. The output field determines the type of document that is created and can be either papaja::apa6_pdf or papaja::apa6_word. Additional arguments can be passed to these functions, e.g. to delete the LaTeX source file after the PDF has been rendered (see ?apa6_pdf for details): output: papaja::apa6_pdf: keep_tex: FALSE 2.1.2.1 Additional rendering options Any additional rendering options supported by rmarkdown::pdf_document() or rmarkdown::word_document() can be added to the YAML front matter. For example, a different citation style can be used by setting csl to the location of a CSL style definition file. For an overview refer see the list of default variables, language variables, and LaTeX variables supported by pandoc and the filter modes supported by pandoc-citeproc. papaja provides one additional rendering option that is not included in the default YAML header. replace_ampersands indicates whether to replace &amp; by and in all in-text citations as required by the APA citation style. The option defaults to yes if no custom CSL file is specified but to no otherwise. To replace ampersands in in-text citations with a custom CSL file add replace_ampersands: yes to the YAML front matter. 2.2 Body The body of R Markdown documents consists of prose written in Markdown interspersed with R code. 2.2.1 Markdown A general principle in typesetting is to separate content and style. Separation is commonly achieved through the use of a markup language, which is a system of document annotations. These annotations declare portions of text as, for example, title, section headings, or list items but, crucially, they are agnostic to what this means visually (e.g., &lt;bold&gt;text&lt;/bold&gt; instead of text). Separation of content and style is useful because it enables swift changes to an entire documents’ style or structure and facilitates applying a common style across multiple documents. Microsoft Word implements this strategy in their so-called styles, which are collections of formatting instructions that can be assigned to portions of the text. papaja uses the Markdown syntax to separate content and style. Markdown was desigend to be an easy-to-read and -write formatting syntax. The key design goal was to create a syntax that is readable as-is. The following is an excerpt from the APA example manuscript written in Markdown. # Methods ## Participants Younger adults (14 women, 10 men, $M_{age} = 19.5$ years, age range: 18–22 years) were recruited with flyers posted on the Boston College campus. &lt;!-- TODO: Add flyer to appendix! --&gt; Older adults (15 women, nine men, $M_{age} = 76.1$ years, age range: 68–84 years) were recruited through the Harvard Cooperative on Aging (see Table 1, for demographics and test scores).[^p] [^p]: Analyses of covariance were conducted with these covariates, with no resulting influences of these variables on the pattern or magnitude of the results. Without any prior knowledge of Markdown it should be easy to guess what most of this syntax does: # and ## denote first and second order section headings (and so on), &lt;!-- and --&gt; surround comments that will not be displayed in the rendered document, and [^p] adds a reference to a footnote that is written out following [^p]:. The equations surrounded by $ may be somewhat less intuitive. In R Markdown, equations are written in LaTeX’s powerful mathematics syntax (also see Equations). For an overview of the Markdown syntax see Markdown text formatting. 2.2.2 R code There are two ways to include R code in R Markdown documents. The primary method is to use so-called code chunks. ```{r, code-chunk, echo = FALSE} age_mean &lt;- mean(demographics$age) ``` Code chunks are surrounded by ``` and should be preceeded and followed by an empty line. The behavior of code chunks can be controlled by passing comma-separated options surrounded by braces to the chunk. The first option is compulsory and specifies what langauge the code chunk contains and usually be r, but other languages, such as python, stan, or SQL are supported. RStudio’s knitr language engines documentation provides an overview of all supported languages. The second option of a code chunk is its label or name, here code-chunk. It is good practice to provide a meaningful name for each chunk because chunk names briefly describe the following codes purpose and, hence, are a means of structuring and documenting the code serve as meaningful names for graphic files that the chunks produce are required to control when the code of a cached chunk has to be rerun because a preceeding chunk has changed (see Caching expensive computations). By default, papaja sets the chunk options echo = FALSE and message = FALSE for all chunks. echo = FALSE means that the code chunk is run but hides the code and message = FALSE hides any messages generated by the code so that they are not included in the manuscript. Both settings can be overwritten if desired. See the knitr chunk options and package options for a overview of available settings. R code can also be inserted into in a line of text, for example `r mean(demographics$age)`. Writing R code inline is a convenient way of reporting results of computations in the running text. For example, the mean and standard deviation of participants’ age are stored in variables named age_mean and age_sd. These numbers can be reported by printing the variables in inline R code. Participants mean age was `r age_mean` years ($SD = `r age_sd`$). As in any other R script, R code is executed from top to bottom. Thus, any variables that are called in code chunks or inline R code must be defined above. Reporting numerical values frequently requires some formatting, such as rounding or filling with trailing zeros (e.g., 24.10). In the section Numerical values, we provide an overview of papaja functions that can be used to easily format simple numbers or results from statistical analyses according to APA guidelines. We hope to automate the word count in the future. For now, we recommend using the wordcountaddin package (Marwick, n.d.) to count the words in R Markdonw documents. Note, that counting words in R Markdown documents may underestimate the word count in the final document because the R Markdown document does not include the properly formatted citations and does not contain the results of analyses. An alternative approach is to use the texcount command line tool on the TeX-file generated by papaja::apa6_pdf().↩ "],
["writing.html", "3 Writing 3.1 Markdown text formatting 3.2 Citations 3.3 Tables 3.4 Figures 3.5 Equations 3.6 Cross-referencing 3.7 Appendices", " 3 Writing RStudio Section overview Spell check 3.1 Markdown text formatting A comprehensive overview of the supported Markdown syntax is provided by RStudio’s R Markdown documentation. 3.2 Citations If you are not already using a reference manager, such as Zotero, I strongly suggest you start doing so. Reference managers are like iTunes for your literature; they help you search, download, and organize papers. Most importantly, with a few clicks you can export a collection of references you need for a paper into a .bib-file. By default, citations in R Markdown are formatted by pandoc-citeproc, a filter that pandoc applies as it renders the final document. The advantage of using pandoc-citeproc is that it works equally well for both PDF and Microsoft Word documents. To start citing, supply a Bib(La)TeX (or for example EndNote, RIS, Medline) file to the bibliography parameter in the YAML front matter (bibliography: my.bib). Once the R Markdown file knows where to look for reference [@james_1890] will create a citation within parentheses (James, 1890). Multiple citations must be separated by ; (e.g., [@james_1890; @bem_2011]) and are ordered alphabetically as per APA style (Bem, 2011; James, 1890). To cite a source in text simply omit the brackets; for example, write @james_1890 to cite James (1890). Additional information can be added to citations as pre- or postfixes. Pre- and postfixes can simply be added to each citation by writing inside the brackets ([e.g., @bem_2011]). Note that pre- and postfixes are bound to the enclosed citation, not to the set of all citations. Hence, a prefix will be reorder together with its citation, which may be undesirable. For example, [e.g., @james_1890; @bem_2011] yields (Bem, 2011; e.g., James, 1890). There is no way to prevent this behavior, so mind the alphabetical order of citations. Further customizations, such as citing only a publications year ([-@bem_2011]) are available, see RStudio’s overview of the R Markdown citation syntax. If you are not interested in creating Microsoft Word documents it’s possible to use NatBib or Bib(La)TeX for reference formatting, which grant a little more flexibility than pandoc-citeproc. To do so, an additional argument has to be supplied to apa6_pdf(): --- output: papaja::apa6_pdf: citation_package: biblatex --- 3.2.1 Citation styles The citation style is automatically set to APA style. Other styles can be set in the YAML front matter by specifying a CSL, or Citations Style Language, file. You can use either one of the large number of existing CSL files, customize an existing CSL file, or create a new one entirely. To change the citation style, add a csl: mystyle.csl to the YAML front matter. See the R Markdown documentation and Citation Style Language for further details. 3.2.2 Conveniently inserting citations with citr citr is an R package that provides functions to search Bib(La)TeX-files to create and insert formatted Markdown citations into the current document. If you use RStudio, the package supplies an easy-to-use RStudio add-in that facilitates inserting citations (Figure 3.1). The references for the inserted citations are automatically added to the documents reference section. Figure 3.1: Demonstration of the RStudio addin from the citr package that inserts R Markdown citations. Once citr is installed (install.packages(&quot;citr&quot;)) and you have restarted your R session, the addin appears in the menus and you can define a keyboard shortcut to call the addin (we suggest Alt+Shift+R). The addin will automatically look up the Bib(La)TeX-file(s) specified in the YAML front matter. If the document does not contain a YAML front matter the addin will attempt to locate a parent document and look up the Bib(La)TeX-file specified therein. That is, the addin works its automagic even if you edit R Markdown documents that are included in another R Markdown document (see Splitting an R Markdown document). The expected names of a parent document default to c(&quot;index.Rmd&quot;, &quot;master.Rmd&quot;), but those can be customized (e.g., options(citr.parent_documents = &quot;my_parent.Rmd&quot;)). citr can also be used without RStudio, albeit it is less convenient. The following call searches a Bib(La)TeX-file and creates formatted Markdown citations for the results. library(&quot;citr&quot;) md_cite(&quot;bem&quot;, bib_file = &quot;references.bib&quot;) md_cite() searches the author, year, title, and journal fields of your references. 3.2.3 Working with a reference manager If you use Zotero or Juris-M citr can access your reference database without previous export. For this to work, you need to install the Better Bib(La)TeX extension, which we recommend even if you don’t intend to use citr. Once the extension is installed and the reference manager is running, citr will automatically access all your references and keep the Bib(La)Tex-file specified in the current R Markdown file up-to-date. If you dislike this behavior, you can disable the automatic access to the reference manager by setting options(citr.use_betterbiblatex = FALSE). 3.2.4 Referencing R and its packages A lot of R packages are developed by academics free of charge. As citations are the currency of science, it’s easy to compensate volunteers for their work by citing the R packages we use. Howerver, citing software is rarely done arguebly because it is tedious work. papaja therefore supplies two functions that make citing R and its packages easy. r_refs(file = &quot;r-references.bib&quot;) my_citations &lt;- cite_r(file = &quot;r-references.bib&quot;) r_refs() creates a BibTeX file containing citations for R and packages that are in use at the time the function is executed. cite_r() takes these citations and turns them into readily reportable text. my_citations now contains the following text that you can use in your document: R (Version 3.4.3; R Core Team, 2016) and the R-packages afex (Version 0.18.0; Singmann et al., 2016), bindrcpp (Version 0.2; Müller, 2017), car (Version 2.1.6; Fox &amp; Weisberg, 2011), citr (Version 0.2.0.9055; Aust, 2016), DiagrammeR (Version 0.9.2; Sveidqvist et al., 2016), dplyr (Version 0.7.4; Wickham &amp; Francois, 2016), estimability (Version 1.2; Lenth, 2015), ez (Version 4.4.0; Lawrence, 2016), knitr (Version 1.19; Xie, 2015), lme4 (Version 1.1.14; Bates et al., 2015), lsmeans (Version 2.27.61; Lenth, 2016), Matrix (Version 1.2.11; Bates &amp; Maechler, 2016), papaja (Version 0.1.0.9655; Aust &amp; Barth, 2016), reshape2 (Version 1.4.2; Wickham, 2007), rmarkdown (Version 1.8; Allaire et al., 2017), shiny (Version 1.0.5; Chang et al., 2016), and wordcountaddin (Version 0.2.0; Marwick, n.d.) If you prefer to cite only a subset of these packages, package names can be specified either as a blacklist, so they won’t be cited (withhold = TRUE), or as a whitelist, so only these packages will be cited (withhold = FALSE). my_citations &lt;- cite_r( file = &quot;r-references.bib&quot; , pkgs = c(&quot;afex&quot;, &quot;lsmeans&quot;, &quot;papaja&quot;) , withhold = FALSE ) R (Version 3.4.3; R Core Team, 2016) and the R-packages afex (Version 0.18.0; Singmann et al., 2016), lsmeans (Version 2.27.61; Lenth, 2016), and papaja (Version 0.1.0.9655; Aust &amp; Barth, 2016) Another option is to cite R in text but move the list of R packges into a footnote. my_citations &lt;- cite_r(file = &quot;r-references.bib&quot;, footnote = TRUE) This way you can reference R in the running text using my_citations$r and place the footnote syntax including the package list my_citations$pkgs in a new paragraph. R (Version 3.4.3; R Core Team, 2016)2 3.3 Tables For prettier tables, I suggest you try apa_table(), which builds on knitr’s kable(). descriptives &lt;- mixed_data %&gt;% group_by(Dosage) %&gt;% summarize( Mean = mean(Recall) , Median = median(Recall) , SD = sd(Recall) , Min = min(Recall) , Max = max(Recall) ) descriptives[, -1] &lt;- printnum(descriptives[, -1]) apa_table( descriptives , caption = &quot;Descriptive statistics of correct recall by dosage.&quot; , note = &quot;This table was created with apa_table()&quot; , escape = TRUE ) Of course popular packages like xtable3 or tables can also be used to create tables when knitting PDF documents. These packages, however, cannot be used when you want to create Microsoft Word documents because they rely on \\(\\LaTeX\\) for typesetting. apa_table() creates tables that conform to APA guidelines and are correctly rendered in PDF and Word documents. But don’t get too excited. In papaja, table formatting is somewhat limited for Word documents due to missing functionality in pandoc (e.g., it is not possible to have cells or headers span across multiple columns). As required by the APA guidelines, tables are deferred to the final pages of the manuscript when creating a PDF. To place tables and figures in your text instead, set the figsintext parameter in the YAML header to yes or true, as I have done in this document. Again, this is not the case in Word documents due to limited pandoc functionality. The bottom line is, Word documents will be less polished than PDF. The resulting documents should suffice to enable collaboration with Wordy colleagues and prepare a journal submission with limited manual labor. 3.3.1 Alternatives Pixidust: https://github.com/nutterb/pixiedust/blob/master/README.md xtable: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xtable/xtable.pdf tables: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tables/vignettes/tables.pdf stargazer: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stargazer/index.html knitr::kable Hmisc::latex https://twitter.com/polesasunder/status/464132152347475968/photo/1 3.4 Figures As usual in R Markdown, you can embed R-generated plots into your document, see Figure 3.2. apa_beeplot( mixed_data , id = &quot;Subject&quot; , dv = &quot;Recall&quot; , factors = c(&quot;Task&quot;, &quot;Valence&quot;, &quot;Dosage&quot;) , dispersion = wsci , level = .95 , ylim = c(0, 30) , las = 1 , args_points = list(cex = 1) , args_arrows = list(length = 0.025) ) Figure 3.2: Beeswarm plot of the example data set. Small points represent individual observations, large points represent means, and error bars represent 95% within-subjects confidence intervals. Again, as required by the APA guidelines, figures are deferred to the final pages of the document unless you set figsintext to yes. papaja provides the functions apa_beeplot, apa_lineplot, and apa_barplot to easily plot data from factorial designs (apa_generic_plot is the underlying workhorse function). They are intended to provide a convenient way to obtain a publication-ready figure with easy-to-learn, human-readable and short syntax; while maintaining enough flexibility for a lot of customizing, if you’re really into this. The basic arguments to these functions are all the same, so you only need to learn one syntax to generate these different types of plots. Moreover, this comes with the additional advantage that you can easily switch between these types of plots by simply replacing some letters in the function call. A basic usage would look like this: apa_beeplot( data = mixed_data , id = &quot;Subject&quot; , dv = &quot;Recall&quot; , factors = c(&quot;Task&quot;, &quot;Valence&quot;, &quot;Dosage&quot;) ) The first argument is the data.frame that contains the data, while the other arguments represent character strings identifying the columns that contain the subject identifier id, the dependent variable dv, and the between- or within-subjects factors. Yet, zero to four factors are supported. Via parameter tendency, you can specify any function that will be used to calculate the measure of central tendency. Via parameter dispersion, you can specify any function that will be used to calculate the measure of dispersion. A little candy: You can also require within-subjects confidence intervals as described by (???) (and we already did in Figure 3.2). If you have more than one observation per participant-factor-level-combination, these observations are aggregated. You can specify individual aggregation functions via fun_aggregate. 3.4.1 What is plotted? For each cell of the submitted data, the following information is plotted: A measure of central tendency. A measure of dispersion. The names of dependent variable, factors and factor levels; a legend, if necessary. The plot functions in papaja are build around the graphics packages that is part of the base distribution of R. A lot of customization can thus be accomplished by calling par. If you are not willing to change these global options, you can pass a lot of parameters to the underlying functions by arguments args_points, args_error_bars, etc. each time you call the plot. See the below example for a more customized version of a beeswarm plot (3.3). apa_beeplot( data = mixed_data , id = &quot;Subject&quot; , dv = &quot;Recall&quot; , factors = c(&quot;Task&quot;, &quot;Valence&quot;, &quot;Dosage&quot;) , args_points = list(cex = 2, bg = c(&quot;skyblue4&quot;, &quot;indianred3&quot;, &quot;seagreen4&quot;), col = &quot;white&quot;) , args_swarm = list(cex = 1.2) , args_error_bars = list(length = .02, col = &quot;grey20&quot;) , args_y_axis = list(las = 1) , main = c(expression(italic(A)~&quot;dosage&quot;), expression(italic(B)~&quot;dosage&quot;), expression(italic(C)~&quot;dosage&quot;)) , dispersion = wsci ) Figure 3.3: A customized beeswarm plot. Note that, by default, the swarm inherits parameters from the args_points argument. A footnote on customization: If you customize the colors in your plots, you can use transparency (i.e., via defining colors with rgb()). However, as soon as you do this, your plots will be included in a pixel-based format in your final document, even if you knit to pdf (usually, when knitting to pdf, R plots are included in a vector-based format). Pixel-based plot graphics are not too bad, but may lead to ugly compression artifacts after you uploaded your manuscript to a manuscript submission system. (We already had that problem in our lab.) If you prefer creating your plots with ggplot2 try theme_apa(). 3.5 Equations If you need to report formulas, you can use the flexible \\(\\LaTeX\\) syntax (it will work in Word documents, too). Inline math must be enclosed in $ or \\( and \\) and the result will look like this: \\(d&#39; = z(\\mathrm{H}) - z(\\mathrm{FA})\\). For larger formulas displayed equations are more appropriate; they are enclosed in $$ or \\[and \\], \\[ d&#39; = \\frac{\\mu_{old} - \\mu_{new}}{\\sqrt{0.5(\\sigma^2_{old} + \\sigma^2_{new})}}. \\] 3.6 Cross-referencing papaja builds on the document formats pdf_document2() and word_document2() from the bookdown package. This enables the use of bookdown cross-referencing syntax including automatically generated table and figure labels as detailed in the bookdown documentation. 3.7 Appendices References "],
["reporting.html", "4 Reporting 4.1 Numerical values 4.2 Results from statistical tests 4.3 Caching expensive computations", " 4 Reporting Using papaja, it is possible to run all your analyses from within an R Markdown document. Any output from R is included as you usually would using R Markdown. By default the R code will not be displayed in the final documents. If you wish to show off your code you need to set echo = TRUE in the chunk options. This section describes how you can include the results of your analyses can be included in text. It starts with simple numerical values (like a sample mean) and then continues with more-complex output, like the results from statistical models and hypothesis tests. papaja comes with two functions (printnum and apa_print) that do the job of formatting everything according to APA guidelines. 4.1 Numerical values Consider a basic example, where you want to include a mean and a standard deviation into text: The function printnum() can be used to include a numeric value into text, with the correct rounding and with or without a leading zero. Just write some inline R code like this: Participants mean age was `r printnum(age_mean)` years (*SD* = `r printnum(age_sd)`). which will result in: Participants mean age was 22.84 years (SD = 3.78). printnum() is quiet flexible and passes its arguments to the underlying base function formatC() (CAVE: We are currently considering to switch to format().), so changing the number of digits after the decimal point or the character to be used to indicate the decimal point (e.g., from a point &quot;.&quot; to a comma &quot;,&quot;) is always possible. papaja applies printnum to any numbers that a printed in inline code chunks. Thus, writing Participants mean age was `r age_mean` years (*SD* = `r age_sd`). also results in: Participants mean age was 22.84 years (SD = 3.78). The function printp() is a shorthand version of printnum() with the correct defaults alread set for printing \\(p\\) values (i.e., printing \\(p &lt; .001\\) instead of the incorrect \\(p = .000\\)). 4.2 Results from statistical tests Output from statistical models and tests needs to be properly formatted before it can be included in text. For this purpose, we created the function apa_print(). Simply drop the results from a statistical test (e.g. a \\(t\\) test or an ANOVA) into apa_print(), and you will get an output object (a list) that contains all you need to report the analysis according to APA guidelines. apa_print() currently supports output objects from a variety of statistical models/tests, including \\(t\\) tests, ANOVA, linear regression. For a full list of supported output objects, see Table ??. Table 4.1: Object classes supported by apa_print().

The formatted text and tables can be reported in a manuscript. 4.2.1 htest (t tests, correlations, etc.) The results of a \\(t\\) test (regardless of the exact type of \\(t\\) test) are typically stored in an htest object. # Cosmetic surgery dataset from # Field, A.

London: Sage. load(&quot;data/cosmetic_surgery.rdata&quot;) t_out &lt;- t.test( x = cosmetic_surgery$Post_QoL , y = cosmetic_surgery$Base_QoL , paired = TRUE ) # Let&#39;s see what the apa_print() output looks like apa_print(t_out) ## $estimate ## [1] &quot;$M_d = -3.95$, 95\\\\% CI $[-4.86$, $-3.04]$&quot; ## ## $statistic ## [1] &quot;$t(275) = -8.52$, $p &lt; .001$&quot; ## ## $full_result ## [1] &quot;$M_d = -3.95$, 95\\\\% CI $[-4.86$, $-3.04]$, $t(275) = -8.52$, $p &lt; .001$&quot; ## ## $table ## NULL As you can see, apa_print() returns a list of four elements: List element estimate contains the sample estimate of mean difference; element statistic contains the result of the NHST with test statistic, dfs, and p value; element full_result contains both information combined. The fourth element, table, contains a table containing test results; while this is NULL for a \\(t\\) test, it will be quiet interesting for ANOVA or linear model results, as you will see in the next subsections. 4.2.2 lm (linear regression) The results of a linear model are stored in an lm object. lm_out &lt;- lm(formula = Post_QoL ~ Base_QoL + BDI, data = cosmetic_surgery) apa_lm &lt;- apa_print(lm_out) Again, apa_print returns a four-elements list. apa_lm$table contains a complete regression table that can be passed to apa_table() to get a full regression table, see Table @ref(tab:lm-table; remember to set the chunk option results = &quot;asis&quot;). apa_table( apa_lm$table , caption = &quot;A full regression table.&quot; , escape = FALSE ) Table 4.2: A full regression table.

Amongst psychologists, analysis of variance is a still-popular and frequently used technique. In base R, however, analysis of variance is not implemented in a way that is too useful for psychologists, as the aov-function in the stats package does not provide the much sought-after Type-\\(\\rm{I\\!I\\!I}\\) sums-of-squares. A variety of R packages has emerged to fill the gap, e.g. car (Fox &amp; Weisberg, 2011), ez (Lawrence, 2016), and afex (Singmann et al., 2016). Unfortunately, each ANOVA function provides different output objects that need to be digested by apa_print(). To do so, we rely on the package authors to return standardized result objects (i.e., S3/S4 classes). For this reason apa_print() does not support results from the popular ezANOVA(). The object returned by this function has no class to inform us about its contents and, thus, cannot be processed. We recommend you try one of the other available packages, e.g. aov_ez() from the afex-package. Functionality. cosmetic_surgery_anova &lt;- afex::aov_ez( data = cosmetic_surgery , dv = &quot;Post_QoL&quot; , id = &quot;ID&quot; , between = c(&quot;Clinic&quot;, &quot;Gender&quot;) ) apa_anova &lt;- apa_print(cosmetic_surgery_anova) Now, you can report the results of your analyses like so: Clinic (`r apa_anova$full$Clinic`) and patient gender affected post-surgery quality of life, `r apa_anova$full$Gender`. However, the effect of gender differed by clinic, `r apa_anova$full$Clinic_Gender`. Which will yield the following text: Clinic (\\(F(9, 256) = 19.98\\), \\(\\mathit{MSE} = 47.58\\), \\(p &lt; .001\\), \\(\\hat{\\eta}^2_G = .413\\)) and patient gender affected post-surgery quality of life, \\(F(1, 256) = 15.29\\), \\(\\mathit{MSE} = 47.58\\), \\(p &lt; .001\\), \\(\\hat{\\eta}^2_G = .056\\). However, the effect of gender differed by clinic, \\(F(9, 256) = 1.97\\), \\(\\mathit{MSE} = 47.58\\), \\(p = .043\\), \\(\\hat{\\eta}^2_G = .065\\). Again, you can easily create a complete ANOVA table by passing recall_anova_results$table to apa_table(), see . apa_table( apa_anova$table , caption = &quot;A really beautiful ANOVA table.&quot; , note = &quot;Note that the column names contain beautiful mathematical copy: This is because the table has variable labels.&quot; ) Table 4.3: A really beautiful ANOVA table.

There are two basic strategies to split R Markdown documents that can be combined or used in isolation: sourcing R scripts and splitting the R Markdown document. If the R Markdown document contains a lot of code, it may be helpful to disincorporate parts of the code, such as reading, merging, restructuring, and relabeling data files. The R scripts can then be executed at the respective section of the document using source(). Some authors may prefer to split long manuscripts into a master or parent document and multiple children. The master document, for example, consists of the YAML front matter and includes the children, which are themselves R Markdown documents without a YAML front matter. To include a child document, insert an empty chunk and provide the path to the R Markdown document in the chunk option child. ```{r child = &quot;introduction.Rmd&quot;} ``` ```{r child = &quot;methods.Rmd&quot;} ``` ```{r child = &quot;results.Rmd&quot;} ``` ```{r child = &quot;discussion.Rmd&quot;} ``` 5.9 Workflow Don’t edit raw data Don’t set a working directory Generate graphics from R code Don’t edit word documents Relative paths 5.10 Troubleshooting 5.10.1 R "],

["limitations.html", "8 Limitations 8.1 PDF documents 8.2 Microsoft Word documents", " 8 Limitations As outlined in Document compilation, papaja builds on pandoc to render Markdown into PDF and DOCX documents. Markdown provides good common basis for these and other document types but the common basis necessarily limits the degree of control that can be exerted over the rendered document. For example, there is currently no way to generate tables with pandoc in which cells span multiple rows or columns. Similarly, it is not possible to insert page breaks into a document. Both of these limitations have been raised with the developers of pandoc (see here and here), but it may take a while for them to be addressed. 8.1 PDF documents pandoc builds on LaTeX to render PDF documents. As discussed in Markdown text formatting, when the R Markdown document contains LaTeX code it is kept as-is and can be used to exert greater control over the final result. For example, to create a page break in the rendered document you can use the LaTeX command \\pagebreak. Similarly, tables with column spanners can be created by using the corresponding LaTeX code. Hence, the limited control offered by pandoc can be compensated by using LaTeX code and papaja resorts to this approach, for example, in apa_table(). 8.2 Microsoft Word documents In contrast, there is no simple way to compensate for the limited control offered by pandoc when rendering Microsoft Word documents. This is the reason why some of papaja’s features are only available if the to-be-rendered document is in PDF format, such as some Rendering options and some features of apa_table() (see Tables). More over, rendered documents in DOCX format require some manual work before they fully comply with APA guidelines. We, therefore, provide the following checklist of necessary changes: add a headder line including running head and page number add horizontal rules above the column titles and below the last table row position start of reference section at the top of a new page move figures and tables to the end of the manuscript in figure captions, add a colon following the figure numbers and italize If necessary, position author note at the bottom of page 1 add colon to level 3-headings add midrules to tables We hope to automated some of these points in the future as the flexibility of pandoc increases.
