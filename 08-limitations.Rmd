# Limitations

## MS word caveat
- apa_table() etc.
- Checklist


- The references in Word violate the APA guidelines in that there is no hanging indentation (i.e. indentation of all lines but the first one). As of now there is no fix for this problem.
- In-text citation incorrectly use ampersands instead of "and". This is a current limitation of the [pandoc-citeproc](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pandoc-citeproc) filter. I'm still looking for ways to fix this.
- Citations may mess with RStudios syntax highlighting in the current line. Incorrect highlighting following a citation does not necessarily indicate incorrect syntax.
- Printing PDF from RStudio's PDF viewer can produce weird results. If you want to print your manuscript I suggest you use any other PDF viewer of your choice.


Due to limitations of the limitted formatting options that `pandoc` offers for Microsoft Word documents, manuscript files created with `papaja` require some manual work before they fully comply with APA guidelines.
We, therefore, provide the following checklist of necessary changes:

@. add a headder line including running head and page number
@. add horizontal rules under last table row
@. position start of reference section at the top of a new page
@. move figures and tables to the end of the manuscript
@. add a colon following the figure numbers and italize
@. remove bold formatting of manuscript title on page 3


If necessary,

@. position author note at the bottom of page 1
@. position abstract at the top of page 2
@. position the beginning of the main text (including the title) at the top of page 3
@. add colon to level 3-headings
@. add midrules to tables

Some of these points may be automated in the future.
