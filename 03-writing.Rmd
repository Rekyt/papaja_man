# Writing

## Workflow

- Don't edit raw data
- Don't set a working directory
- Generate graphics from R code
- Don't edit word documents

Use a reference manager

If you are not already using a reference manager such as Zotero, I strongly suggest you start doing so. Reference managers are like iTunes for your literature; they help you search, download, and organize papers. Most importantly, with a few clicks you can export a collection of references you need for a paper into a .bib-file. Once your references are in a .bib-file that resides in the same folder as your Markdown-file, you can easily add citations to your Markdown document. Each reference has a unique handle, e.g. lewandowsky_computational_2011, which you can use in Markdown. @lewandowsky_computational_2011 creates an in-text citation; [@lewandowsky_computational_2011] creates a citation in parentheses. Everything reference-related, such as in-text citation and the reference section, will be taken cared of automatically.

- RStudio
  - Section overview
  - Spell check

## Citations
No manuscript is complete without citation.
In order for citations to work, you need to supply a Bib(La)TeX file to the `bibliography` parameter in the YAML front matter (`bibliography: my.bib`).
Once this is done, `[e.g., @james_1890; @bem_2011]` produces a regular citation within parentheses [e.g., @james_1890; @bem_2011].
To cite a source in text simply omit the brackets; for example, write `@james_1890` to cite @james_1890.
For other options see the [overview of the R Markdown citation syntax](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html).

The citation style is automatically set to APA style.
If you need to use a different citation style, you can set in the YAML front matter by adding a `csl` parameter.
See the [R Markdown documentation](http://R Markdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html) and [Citation Style Language](http://citationstyles.org/) for further details.

If you use RStudio, I have created an [easy-to-use add-in](https://github.com/crsh/citr) that facilitates inserting citations.
The relevant references will, of course, be added to the documents reference section automatically.


`citr`

> Nachdem ich bei Ihnen die erste Übungen mit R unternommen habe, versuche ich mich derzeit in Papaja (unser gesamtes Lehrgebiet eignet sich derzeit Papayja an). Ich habe allerdings noch nicht herausgefunden, wie ich die alphabetische Sortierung ausschalten kann, z.B. für den Fall (Berthold & Meier, 2009; Wright, 2009; but see Alfred & Bert, 2007). Können Sie mir evtl. weiterhelfen?

### Working with a reference manager

- Bib(La)TeX export of Mendeley
- Better Bib(La)TeX intergration of citr


### Referencing R and its packages

I think it is important to credit the software we use.
A lot of R packages are developed by academics free of charge.
As citations are the currency of science, it's easy to compensate volunteers for their work by citing the R packages we use.
I suspect that, among other things, this is rarely done because it is tedious work.
That's why papaja makes citing R and its packages easy:

```{r echo = TRUE}
r_refs(file = "r-references.bib")
my_citation <- cite_r(file = "r-references.bib")
```

`r_refs()` creates a BibTeX file containing citations for R and all currently loaded packages.
`cite_r()` takes these citations and turns them into readily reportable text.
`my_citation` now contains the following text that you can use in your document: `r my_citation`


## Tables

For prettier tables, I suggest you try `apa_table()`, which builds on `knitr`'s `kable()`.

```{r results = 'asis', echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
descriptives <- mixed_data %>% group_by(Dosage) %>%
  summarize(
    Mean = mean(Recall)
    , Median = median(Recall)
    , SD = sd(Recall)
    , Min = min(Recall)
    , Max = max(Recall)
  )
descriptives[, -1] <- printnum(descriptives[, -1])

apa_table(
  descriptives
  , caption = "Descriptive statistics of correct recall by dosage."
  , note = "This table was created with apa_table()"
  , escape = TRUE
)
```

Of course popular packages like `xtable`[^xtable] or `tables` can also be used to create tables when knitting PDF documents.
These packages, however, cannot be used when you want to create Microsoft Word documents because they rely on \LaTeX for typesetting.
`apa_table()` creates tables that conform to APA guidelines and are correctly rendered in PDF and Word documents.
But don't get too excited.
In papaja, table formatting is somewhat limited for Word documents due to missing functionality in pandoc (e.g., it is not possible to have cells or headers span across multiple columns).

[^xtable]: When you use `xtable()`, table captions are [set to the left page margin](http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/42209/centering-tables-in-document-class-apa6).

As required by the APA guidelines, tables are deferred to the final pages of the manuscript when creating a PDF.
To place tables and figures in your text instead, set the `figsintext` parameter in the YAML header to `yes` or `true`, as I have done in this document.
Again, this is not the case in Word documents due to limited pandoc functionality.
The bottom line is, Word documents will be less polished than PDF.
The resulting documents should suffice to enable collaboration with Wordy colleagues and prepare a journal submission with limited manual labor.

## Figures

As usual in R Markdown, you can embed R-generated plots into your document, see \autoref{fig:bee}.

```{r fig.cap = "Bee plot of the example data set. Small points represent individual observations, large points represent means, and error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. \\label{fig:bee}", echo = TRUE, dev.args = list(bg = 'white'), eval = FALSE}
apa_beeplot(
  mixed_data
  , id = "Subject"
  , dv = "Recall"
  , factors = c("Task", "Valence", "Dosage")
  , dispersion = conf_int
  , ylim = c(0, 30)
  , las = 1
  , args_points = list(cex = 1.5)
  , args_arrows = list(length = 0.025)
)
```

Again, as required by the APA guidelines, figures are deferred to the final pages of the document unless you set `figsintext` to `yes`.

- barplot
- lineplot
- violinplot/beeswarm

Be sure to also check out `apa_barplot()` and `apa_beeplot()` if you work with factorial designs.
If you prefer creating your plots with `ggplot2` try `theme_apa()`.

## Equations

If you need to report formulas, you can use the flexible \LaTeX syntax (it will work in Word documents, too).
Inline math must be enclosed in `$` or `\(` and `\)` and the result will look like this: $d' = z(H) - z(FA)$.
For larger formulas displayed equations are more appropriate; they are enclosed in `$$` or `\[`and `\]`,

$$
d' = \frac{\mu_{old} - \mu_{new}}{\sqrt{0.5(\sigma^2_{old} + \sigma^2_{new})}}.
$$

## Cross-referencing

Currently, `rmarkdown` does not support proper cross-referencing with the document.
For this document, I have simply interspersed my R markdown document with \LaTeX to accomplish cross-references.
A new version of pandoc (1.16), that is not *yet* shipped with RStudio, supports proper cross-referencing that will work with Word documents as well.
